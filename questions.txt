/* GAME OF THRONES THEMED JEOPARDY GAME
game will be set up using HTML and CSS (i.e.: the categories will be populated,
    along with the score options for each question [but NOT the actual question])
JS will be used from the beginning game board

first screen: blurred background of the game board, and in the foreground:
a modal asking the player for their name

once the player enters something and hits enter, the game begins

player will have x number of categories to choose from, and each category
will have y number of cards

player will click on the card they want to start with

the card zooms into focus, and the rest of the game board gets blurred in
the background again

a countdown begins for 60 seconds, and the player must answer the question shown

once they type in their answer and hit submit, 
the answer gets checked with the answer I've given the game

the game board comes back into focus, with the already-played cards marked as COMPLETED,
and the points get updated

player clicks again, game continues

at the end of the game, depending on their score, they will receive a customized message, 
with a chance to play again
*/

/* FLOW
[game board set up using HTML & CSS]

const playerName = player's name from the initial input option
this will be used throughout the game for a more personalized feel

each category will have its own object, with each question and answer in the object

                    a: ["battle of blackwater, "blackwater", "black water" ],
