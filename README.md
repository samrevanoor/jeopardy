# Game of Thrones-themed Jeopardy!
## by Sam Revanoor

<br>

### **Background**

For my first browser game, I combined two of my favourite things: Game of Thrones and the TV show Jeopardy!
<br>
<br>
Jeopardy (<em>styled as Jeopardy!</em>) is a television game show that features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions.
<br>
<br>
Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama television series based on a series of novels by George R. R. Martin.
<br>
<br>
My game has a slight twist on Jeopardy, where I don't ask the player to enter the whole question, but rather just the correct response (usually one word or phrase).
<br>

### **Rules**
- Players can choose between 3 levels
- Players have 30 seconds to answer each question
- The questions do not have to be answered in any particular order
- Correct answers add points to the player's total accordingly
- Wrong answers do not change the player's total points
- The maximum points a player can get is 300 (if they guess every question correctly)
- The minimum points a player can get is 0 (if they guess every question incorrectly)
- Player will only have one chance to answer each question
- Player can reset the game at any time

This is the landing page of the game, where players can choose their level. Once they enter their name and click on _Start_, the game will begin.

This is the game board page, with 5 categories and 3 questions for each category. Players can click on the option they want to try guessing first (it does not have to be done in any specific order).
<br>
<br>

When a player clicks on the question they want to answer, the question "card" takes over the page and a 30-second timer begins.
<br>
<br>
If the player guesses correctly (see below), confetti will fall down the page. If they guess incorrectly, a dragon will blow fire on them! If they fail to guess in 30 seconds, the question is marked as incorrect and they return back to the game board page.

When they return back to the game board page, the question is marked as "completed" and the points are updated (if they got it right).
<br>
<br>

At the end of the game, depending on how many points the player has accumulated, they will see a personalized message at the end and an opportunity to play again.
